# EcoHaul, Trash Collection App
EcoHaul is an application designed to address the growing challenge of waste management in Indonesia, where inefficient infrastructure and limited access to recycling services hinder effective waste disposal. With Indonesia ranking fifth globally in waste production, EcoHaul serves as a vital platform that connects consumers with recycling and waste collection services. The application features convenient options for waste pick-up and drop-off, as well as a newsletter aimed at raising public awareness about the importance of recycling. By bridging the gap between consumers and recycling services, EcoHaul seeks to enhance waste management practices and contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable environment.

## Additional Information
EcoHaul application was developed as a final project for two university courses: Software Engineering and Web Programming. Utilizing Laravel 11 for backend development, Bootstrap 5 for responsive front-end design, and MySQL for database management, this application showcases the skills and knowledge acquired throughout these courses. Through this project, we aim to not only fulfill academic requirements but also create a meaningful tool that promotes environmental sustainability and efficient waste management.
